# MERN-Project
This is a project I have made to learn about the MERN web stack. 
This project allows users to post and look at different watch images as well as leave likes, comments. 

## Current features: 
1. Passportjs authentication
2. Persistent user log in 
3. Asynchronous calls to fetch and post data 
4. Route blocking 
5. User posts
6. User comments 
7. Voting system: users can vote on wrist shots that they like and the wrist shots with the most likes will go to the top of the home page. 
8. User Profile where they can see their posts 

## Future features:  
These are features that I may or may not add in the future given the time. 
1. Notifications system
2. Selective loading, only loading a certain amount of wrist shots at a time
3. Image saving on db (right now I am simply using urls)

## Usage
To use this project on your own machine you will need to connect it to Mongodb, the current URI is no longer active and serves no purpose. 
Simply replace the URI in the .env file with your own. 

## Still Learning: 
A lot of things can be improved in this project. My intention is to improve this project with time as I learn more.
